## Meet and Greet

In groups of 2-4 introduce yourself to people around you.

Some questions to consider:

- What questions do you try to answer with data?
- What data do you collect/use for your research?
- What computer tools do you use for data collection/management/analysis?

I need help.   
Can someone help me please?

## 3 important tabs

RStudio Cloud - URL on the white board   
slido.com   - Event code on the white board  
[bit.ly/dogucu-workshops](http://bit.ly/dogucu-workshops) - Check for today's materials

## Please do

- Ask questions 
- Ask for help
- Help each other
- Wear a name tag

---
## Please do not

- Copy-paste my code from slides (running into problems while typing is part of the learning).
- Judge anyone or question.

---
## Why R?

- Community (definitely the number 1 reason). 
- It is free.
- It is open source (more on this later).

---

## What is tidyverse?

I will explain this later.

##  Data Science Cycle

## Note on My Teaching Style

- I do not teach in a linear fashion.
- This is intentional. 
- If you are considering teaching R in your courses or elsewhere, I am happy to discuss pedagogical approaches to teaching R.
- I am happy to discuss teaching data science and data literacy too.

## Fun fact

Throughout the workshop I provide fun facts. Here is the first one: R just turned 20 years old on 2020-02-29.

```{r fig.align ='center'}
ggplot() +
  geom_emoji('birthday') +
  theme_void()
```
