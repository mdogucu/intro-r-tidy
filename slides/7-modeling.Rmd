## Some Data Wrangling

Recode the `race` variable as

1 - white  
2 - black  
3 - other  

```{r echo = FALSE}
birthwt <- birthwt %>% 
  mutate(race = case_when(race == 1 ~ "white",
                          race == 2 ~ "black",
                          race == 3 ~ "other"))

```

## Response variable 

bwt

Check the distribution

---
## Question

We want to know whether there is a difference in bwt weight of babies who have mothers who smoke and those who do not. 

Answer this question with a visual and a summary statistic.

We will then model it and make an inference.
---
## Linear Model 

Response variable: bwt

Explanatory variable: smoke 

```{r}
lm(bwt ~ smoke, data = birthwt)
```

---
## Linear Model 

```{r}
lm(bwt ~ smoke, data = birthwt) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

broom::tidy gives a results table that is a tibble. We can easily extract parts of this table or even write it to a .csv file.
---
## Question

Can variance in `bwt` be explained by mother's `age`. Add age variable to the model. Make visualizations showing the relationship between the three variables.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(birthwt, aes(x = age, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(smoke~.)
```

---

## Multiple Predictors

```{r}
lm(bwt ~ smoke+age, data = birthwt) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

---
## Interaction

```{r}
lm(bwt ~ smoke*age, data = birthwt) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

---
## More than 2 levels

```{r}
lm(bwt ~ race, data = birthwt) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```


R always takes the levels in alphabetical order. In this case raceblack is the reference group. 
---
## Final Model

```{r}
final_model <- lm(bwt ~ smoke*age + race, data = birthwt)
```

---
## Model Fit

`glance()` provide many model fit indices.

```{r}
broom::glance(final_model) 
```

---
## Predictions and Residuals


```{r}
birthwt %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(final_model) %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(final_model)
```

---
## Normality of residuals 

Check to see if residuals are normally distributed?

```{r}
birthwt <- birthwt %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(final_model) %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(final_model)
```

---
## Residual plot

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
birthwt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
