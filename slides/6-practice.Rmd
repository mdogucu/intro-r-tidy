## LAPD dataset


1. How many full time staff are there? 
2. How many different job class titles are there?
3. Which of the Employment Type group earn the highest Hourly or Event Rate? 
4. Do you notice anything interesting? Investigate. 
5. Is this interesting thing only limited to a single year?

## LAPD dataset 2018

6. Moving on we will only use 2018 dataset. Subset the data to only keep observations from 2018 and variables `Employment Type`, `Hourly or Event Rate`, `Total Payments`, `Average Health Cost`, and `Benefits Plan`.

7. Write this subset data to a file called `lapd_subset,csv`.

## LAPD dataset 2018 - Total Payments

8. Start a fresh new .Rmd document. Read in `lapd_subset.csv`.

9. What does the distribution of Total Payments look like? What is your expectation?

10. What are the minimum and maximum total payments?

---
## LAPD dataset 2018 - Benefits

11. How many people have the "Police" benefits plan?

12. What is the percentage of those who have the "Police" benefits plan?
